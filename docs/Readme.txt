DESCRIPTION

This program will cycle through all your images in your Pictures or My Pictures
folder and display each of them as your desktop background for 5 minutes.

Unfortunatly, .png files do not work currently.




SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

1. Windows XP or above is required. Sorry this software is specific to 
   Windows, but that is the inherent nature of background images. I want to 
   eventually make it work on other platforms.
   
   It might work on Windows operating systems prior to Windows XP
   but I cannot test those.
   
2. Java 1.6 or above is required. You can check your version of Java by 
   opening a Command Prompt and typing "java -version":
   
   Detailed directions:
        1. Hold down the Windows Key and press "R".
        2. Type "cmd" and hit the [Enter] key.
        3. Type "java -version" and hit the [Enter] key.
        
   Output looks similar to this, with the version in the first line:
        java version "1.7.0_45"
        Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.7.0_45-b18)
        Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 24.45-b08, mixed mode)
   



RECOMMENDED SOFTWARE

1. The latest version of Java is highly recommended for the best performance
   and security. As of January 13, 2014 the latest version of Java is 1.7.0_45.
   There are no security issues with WallpaperSwitch. But there are with the
   Java web browser plugin which is not related to WallpaperSwitcher at all.
   
   If you go to web sites that use Java applets (note that this is completely
   different from JavaScript as almost all web sites use JavaScript) you
   should make sure you have the latest version of Java to prevent a hacker
   from accessing your computer.
   
   Download Java from java.com, but be sure to uncheck the checkbox for
   the Ask Toolbar during the install because I'm sure you don't want that. 
   
2. I suggest installing my tool which prevents Java from installing unwanted 
   software like the Ask Toolbar:

3. If you've already accidentally installed the Ask Toolbar or other similar
   unwanted software, there is a tool called AdwCleaner to remove them:
